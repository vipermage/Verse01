			<p id="p1">Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed,not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence,continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
			Philippians 2:1-2, 5, 12 NIV
			</p>
			<p id="p2" class="pbc">Dear brothers and sisters, if another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself. Share each other’s burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ. If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself. You are not that important.”
            ‭‭Galatians‬ ‭6‬:‭1‬-‭3‬ ‭NLT‬‬</p>

	<div id="div2" class="pw" >
	
	<p id="p3">Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love.
	2 Peter 1:2-3, 5-7 NIV
	</p>
	<p id="p4" class="pbc">"Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves." "Not everyone who calls out to me, ‘Lord! Lord!’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. "
        Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock."
    ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭7‬:‭15‬, ‭21‬, ‭24‬ ‭NLT‬‬</p>

	<p id="p5">He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
				Mark 16:15-16 NIV
	</p>
	<p id="p6" class="pbc">"Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened." But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,"
    1 Peter 3:8, 14-15 NIV<</p>

	<p id="p1">"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you." The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Then the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent."
    Deuteronomy 31:6, 8, 15 NIV</p>
	<p id="p2">"Praise the Lord. How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and fitting to praise him! Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit. Sing to the Lord with grateful praise; make music to our God on the harp. His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of the warrior; the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love. He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his laws. Praise the Lord." Psalms 147:1, 5, 7, 10-11, 20 NIV</p>
